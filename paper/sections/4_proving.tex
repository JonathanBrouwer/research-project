section{Proving Techniques}

The properties that have been proven can be divided into three types of properties: Preconditions, Invariants and Postconditions \cite{meyer_1992}. Preconditions are properties that must be true when a function is called, postconditions must be true after a function is called, and invariants are properties that must be true of all values of a certain type. In this section it will be shown that these three types of properties each have their own way to be proven in Agda.
\subsection{Properties to prove}

First, all things that have been proven are listed, sorted into one of the types of properties: \linebreak 
\textbf{Invariants of a QuadTree:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Depth invariant: The depth of a QuadTree must be less than or equal to $\left \lceil{log_{2}( max(width, height))}\right \rceil$. This is to ensure that each coordinate maps to exactly one value.
    \item Compression invariant: No node can have four leaves that are identical. These need to be fused into a single leaf quadrant. This is needed to keep the QuadTree fast and space efficient.
\end{itemize} 
\textbf{Preconditions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When calling atLocation, getLocation, setLocation or mapLocation, the location must be inside of the QuadTree.
    \item When calling lensLeaf, the quadrant needs to have a maximum depth of zero
    \item When calling lensA/B/C/D, the quadrant needs to have a maximum depth that is greater than zero
\end{itemize} 
\textbf{Postconditions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The lenses returned by all the lens functions satisfy the lens laws: \cite{lens}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item view l (set l v s) = v (Setting and then getting returns the value)
            \item set l (view l s) s = s (Setting the value to what it already was doesn't change anything)
            \item set l v2 (set l v1 s) = set l v2 s (Setting a value twice is the same as setting it once)
        \end{itemize}
    \item The functor implementations for Quadrant and QuadTree satisfy the functor laws
        \begin{itemize}
            \item fmap id = id (Identity law)
            \item fmap (f . g) == fmap f . fmap g (Composition law)
        \end{itemize}
    \item The foldable implementation returns an output of the correct length
        \begin{itemize}
            \item length quadtreeFoldable vqt = width * height
        \end{itemize}
    \item The foldable implementation satisfies the foldable-functor law
        \begin{itemize}
            \item foldMap f = fold . fmap f
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Techniques to prove invariants}
Invariants are proven by creating a new datatype with one constructor, which takes the original datatype and a proof for all the invariants. As a simple example, this would be a natural number with the invariant that it is greater than 5.
\begin{minted}{agda}
data GreaterThanFive : Set where
  CGreaterThanFive : (n : Nat) -> { .( IsTrue (n > 5) ) } -> GreaterThanFive
\end{minted}
The proof is marked as implicit \{\} so that it is removed when compiled to Haskell, and it is marked as as irrelevant .() so that will not interfere when proving postconditions later. 

Using this technique, the datatype for a quadrant which is compressed and has a certain maximum depth is: (The datatype for a valid QuadTree is defined very similarly)
\begin{minted}{agda}
data VQuadrant (t : Set) {dep : Nat} : Set where
  CVQuadrant : (qd : Quadrant t) 
            -> {.(IsTrue (depth qd <= dep && isCompressed qd))} 
            -> VQuadrant t {dep}
\end{minted}
Agda2hs flawlessly compiles this to the following, where the proof is erased:
\begin{minted}{haskell}
data VQuadrant t = CVQuadrant (Quadrant t)
\end{minted}

The advantage of making a new datatype over adding the proofs to the original datatype is that if the original datatype has multiple constructors, the datatype does not have to be case split when access to the proofs is needed. The disadvantage is however that this additional wrapper type is visible when compiled to Haskell. To avoid this, one can create a second function of all public functions that take the invariance proof as a precondition, and call the original functions with the wrapper type. 

\subsection{Techniques to prove preconditions}
There are 2 techniques to prove preconditions.

\subsubsection{Using an implicit argument}
Using the first technique, preconditions are proven by adding the proofs as implicit arguments to the function.
As a simple example, this would be a function that takes a natural number greater than 5.
\begin{minted}{agda}
takesGtFive : (n : Nat) -> { .( IsTrue (n > 5) ) } -> ?
\end{minted}
As with invariants, the proof is marked as implicit and irrelevant. 

Using this technique, it can be proven that the location must be inside the tree for getLocation: (the proofs for setLocation and mapLocation are similar)
\begin{minted}{agda}
isInsideQuadTree : (Nat × Nat) -> QuadTree t -> Bool
isInsideQuadTree (x , y) (Wrapper (w , h) _) = x < w && y < h

getLocation : (loc : Nat × Nat) -> {dep : Nat} 
    -> (qt : QuadTree t) 
    -> {.( IsTrue (isInsideQuadTree loc qt) )} -> t
\end{minted}
After being compiled with agda2hs, the implicit argument is removed from the function, just like with implicit constructor arguments.
\begin{minted}{haskell}
getLocation :: (Nat, Nat) -> QuadTree t -> t
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Using a datatype with invariants}
Using the second technique, proofs are proven by passing in a datatype with an invariant, as was used in section 4.2. The simple example from 4.3.1 would then be written like this, using the type defined in section 4.2:
\begin{minted}{agda}
takesGtFive : (n : GreaterThanFive) -> ?
\end{minted}

For the QuadTree verification, this was used to encode the maximum depth properties of the lens functions, using the same datatype that was defined for the invariants.
\begin{minted}{agda}
lensLeaf : Lens (VQuadrant t {0}) t
lensA : {dep : Nat} 
    -> Lens (VQuadrant t {S dep}) (VQuadrant t {dep})
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Comparison}
The advantages of using implicit arguments is that one does not have to be define a separate datatype, and that the proof can be dependent on more than one argument. On the other hand, the advantages of the second method is that the defined function are cleaner and more compact. It is then also possible to use the type as an parameter to another type, like it is used in lensLeaf and lensA, and it allows for cleaner reuse of the property.

\subsection{Techniques to prove postconditions}
Postconditions are proven as separate functions. As a simple example, this is a proof that this function returns a number greater than 5.
\begin{minted}{agda}
gt5 : Bool -> Nat
gt5 _ = 42

gt5-is-gt5 : (b : Bool) -> IsTrue (gt5 b > 5)
gt5-is-gt5 b = IsTrue.itsTrue
\end{minted}

For the QuadTree verification, this technique was used to verify the lens laws of all the lenses defined in the implementation. For example, this is the proof that the ViewSet law holds for lensLeaf.
\begin{minted}{agda}
ValidLens-Leaf-ViewSet : 
    -> (v : t) (s : VQuadrant t {0}) 
    -> view (lensLeaf {t}) (set (lensLeaf {t}) v s) ≡ v
ValidLens-Leaf-ViewSet v (CVQuadrant (Leaf x)) = refl
\end{minted}

When proving preconditions and invariants, these properties have to be marked as irrelevant. This is to ensure that when proving that two function calls are equal, one does not need to show that the proves of the preconditions and invariants are equal (Since the actual value of proofs is irrelevant).

\subsection{Results}
All of the properties mentioned in section 4.1 have been successfully proven. The implementation took approximately 900 lines of Agda code, and the verification took approximately 1500 lines of Agda code. The time it took to implement this library was only a few days, but the verification took several weeks, though this may be biased by the implementation just being a translation across languages. Whether this time is worth it, depends on the situation. For example, in a situation where even one small error could bring down an airplane, this is clearly worth it, however in most situations it is not.

During the verification phase, one bug that was introduced during the translation to Agda. (The bug was in the foldable implementation with quadtrees that are very wide in comparison with their height). This was not caught by the tests, though this may be because the tests on the foldable implementation are very limited (it was always testing square quadtrees).
