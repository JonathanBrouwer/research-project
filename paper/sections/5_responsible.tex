\section{Responsible Research}
In this paper the QuadTree library is implemented and verified, and the techniques (method) used to do so are presented. These techniques are written with the goal that a reader who is trying to implement and verify their own library, can do so using these techniques, and reproduce the results. When there are doubts on how these techniques are actually applied, the code for this project is released on GitHub, so anyone who wants to verify that the techniques really work can see how they were applied in this project. It is also important that other research which aims to improve on the ideas presented in this paper, can do so. This is why the code is released in the public domain, so other researchers can use it and improve on it in their research.
