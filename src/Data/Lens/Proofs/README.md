- [LensLaws.agda](https://github.com/JonathanBrouwer/research-project/blob/master/src/Data/Lens/Proofs/LensLaws.agda) - This defines the lens laws that need to be proven for something to be a valid Lens.
- [LensPostulates.agda](https://github.com/JonathanBrouwer/research-project/blob/master/src/Data/Lens/Proofs/LensPostulates.agda) - This postulates a few properties of lenses that I was unable to prove. (They should be provable I think, so they are not axioms) 
- [LensComposition.agda](https://github.com/JonathanBrouwer/research-project/blob/master/src/Data/Lens/Proofs/LensComposition.agda) - This proves that if we take 2 valid lenses and compose them, the result is also a valid lens.
